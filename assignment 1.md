## Assignment 1

Based on the histograms and scatter plot matrix, here are some interesting conclusions:

1. Distribution: The histograms for miles per gallon (MPG) and weight show
   distribution that are skewed toward lower values.  Acceleration looks
   normally distributed.  Model year has a uniform-like distribution.
   Cylinder and origin are discrete, mainly clustered at three values each.

2. Relationships: MPG appears inversely related to displacement, horsepower
   and weight, which is reasonable.  Cars with higher horsepower typically
   have lower MPG, which aligns with the expectation that powerful engines
   consume more fuel.  Also, heavier vehicles usually have larger engines.

3. Outliers: The data is well-behaved, with few outliers. 

# Question 1

Based on the correlation heatmap plot:

1. There is strong negative correlation between MPG and weight, displacement, and horsepower, as suggested by the initial analysis above.

2. There is strong positive correlation between weight, displacement, and horsepower, also as seen in earlier plots.

3. Model year is positive correlated (although weakly) with MPG, which makes sense.

# Question 2

No, correlation does not imply causation. There may be other underlying factors influencing these variables.

# Question 3

There may be different types of variation in this data set, for example:

1.  Natural variation:
    *   This occurs due to inherent differences among the cars themselves (e.g., size, engine design, materials used).  Also, changes and improvements in automotive engineering over time can lead to changes in vehicle performance, for example enhanced fuel efficiency, as seen in Question 2 above.

3.  Measurement variation:
    *   There can be slight inaccuracies in how the original data was measured. This could involve rounding errors, measurement inconsistencies or imprecise methods.
